# AnomalyDetectionLSTM

Anomaly detection with LSTM recurrent neural network on data from physical smart grid testbed.

smart grid testbed consists of busses, transmission lines, switches and generators. Anomaly detection was implemented at each part of the elements.

Data is simple and consists of timestamp and data values.
